    "> Brute Force Algorithms are exactly what they sound like â€“ straightforward methods of solving a problem that rely on sheer computing power and trying every possibility rather than advanced techniques to improve efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A classic example in computer science is the traveling salesman problem (TSP). Suppose a salesman needs to visit 10 cities across the country. How does one determine the order in which those cities should be visited such that the total distance traveled is minimized?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The brute force solution is simply to calculate the total distance for every possible route and then select the shortest one. This is not particularly efficient because it is possible to eliminate many possible routes through clever algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The time complexity of brute force is O(mn), which is sometimes written as O(n*m) . So, if we were to search for a string of \"n\" characters in a string of \"m\" characters using brute force, it would take us n * m tries."

Since the algorithms today have to operate on large data inputs, it is essential for our algorithms to have a reasonably fast running time."
